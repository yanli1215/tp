## Design

### Architecture

![Architect class diagram](UML diagrams/OverviewClassDiagram.png)

The Architecture Diagram above gives an overview of the different components in the application. Details of the
individual components are given below.

Mojo class controls the overall logic for the application. It is responsible for

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of 4 components:

* Login: Links the user to their account.
* Email: Stores and manages the user's email.
* Utilities: Consists of Ui, Storage and Parser helper class. Ui interacts with the user. Storage reads data from, and
  writes data to the hard disk. Parser parse user's input into instructions that can be understood by the application.
* Command: In charge of executing the user's request.

For these four components,

* The Login component exposes its functionality through the LoginController class.
* The Email component exposes its functionality through the EmailManager class
* The Utilities component consists of Ui, Storage and Parser classes.
* The Command component exposes its functionality through different command classes that inherit from a base Command
  class.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other where the user issues the command `send 1`
![Architect sequence diagram](Sequence Diagrams/OverviewSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### Utilities Component

The Utilities component contains the main classes that run the main functions of Mojo.

![Utility diagram](UML diagrams/Utilities.jpeg)

The Utilities Class Diagram given above shows how the classes in the Utilities component interact with each other and
classes from other component.

The Utilities Component consists for 3 classes.

* `Parser`: Breaks down user input into relevant objects.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the local disk.
* `Ui`: Handles the input and output of the application.

### Login Component

The login component consists of the classes that run the main functions of the Login user Interface
![Login Component Class Diagram](UML diagrams/LoginComponentClassDiagram.png)
The **Login Class Diagram** give above shows how the classes in the Login Component interact with each other

The Login Component consists of 5 components.

* <code> LoginController </code> The LoginController handles the login process and control logic of the login process.
* <code> LoginManager </code> The LoginManager provides the logic to verify the user login details
* <code> LoginUi </code> The LoginUi defines the display and gets input from the user. LoginUi extends the functionality of the Ui class
* <code> LoginInfo </code> The LoginInfo contains the attributes and methods of each LoginInfo object from a particular user logging into MojoHR application
* <code> LoginInfoFileManager </code> The LoginInfoFileManager is responsible for the logic that handles the storage and retrieval of login information

### Email Component

The email component consists of classes that are involved with all the emails
![Email Component Class Diagram](UML diagrams/EmailClassDiagram.png)
The **Login Class Diagram** give above shows how the classes in the Email Component interact with each other

The Email Component consists of 8 components.

* <code> Email </code> is the parent class to the other email classes and contains all the information that is required in an email
* <code> Archive </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Deleted </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Draft </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Inbox </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Junk </code> inherits from Email
* <code> Sent </code> inherits from Email
* <code> EmailManager </code> is responsible for the logic of retrieving Emails as a whole

## Implementation

### ListCommand

There are seven variations of the <code> list </code> command.

1. List by All email(s)
2. List by Archived email(s)
3. List by Deleted email(s)
4. List by Draft(s) email(s)
5. List by Inbox email(s)
6. List by Junk email(s)
7. List by Sent email(s)

The sequence diagram shows how the <code>list (type)</code> operation work.

![ListCommand Sequence Diagram](Sequence Diagrams/ListCommand.png)

### TagCommand

`TagCommand` allows the user to tag a specific email with a number of tags.

The sequence diagram shows how the <code> tag </code> operation work.
![Tag Sequence Diagram](Sequence Diagrams/TagSequenceDiagram.png)

### ComposeCommand

When the `compose` command is entered, the software will prompt user to enter the necessary details and save them to
draft.

The details needed are receiver email, subject and content. The time the draft was composed would be saved
automatically.

The sequence diagram roughly shows how the `compose` operation works.

## Product Scope

### Target User Profile

Busy HR Personnel

### Value Proposition

The HR department receives many emails from job seekers. A large portion of their day is spent clearing emails. Thus,
our product seeks to allow the user to clear emails more efficiently by streamlining the process. This will reduce the
time spent on clearing emails and allow HR personnel to focus on more productive things
(from clearing emails to classifying important emails).

## Instructions for manual testing

This section explains the instructions on how to test the app manually

:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are
expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

### Launch and shutdown

1. Ensure that Java 11 is installed.
2. Download the latest version of `MojoHR` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113-W10-2/tp/releases/latest).
3. Copy the jar file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for `MojoHR`.
4. Open your Command Line Terminal in the folder where the jar file is located, and run it with `java -jar Mojo.jar`.
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `list archive`
   and pressing Enter will show the list of archived emails.
6. To terminate the app, use the `bye` command. Interrupt the Command Line Terminal with `Ctrl+C`
   or closing the terminal is also allowed.

### Saving data

Data for all accounts' email addresses and passwords are stored in `LoginInfo.txt`, whereas data of each email account
is stored in its own json file.

Details of Files:

* The json file will be automatically created when creating an account in our software.
* Each json file contains the account's email address, password, and all emails.
* Are automatically loaded when MojoHR starts.
* Are automatically updated upon commands that would cause a change in the file, such as creating an account, sending or
  deleting an email.

**Note**: Testers are not advised to manually modify any data files unless they become familiar. This is to prevent data
files from corrupting.
